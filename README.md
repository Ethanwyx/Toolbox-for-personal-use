**source code**  
The original source code of the entire program has been added. This program includes two functions: converting subtitle files to plain text and extracting MP3 audio from MP4 videos.  
**New UI and framework**  
- Migrated the UI from Tkinter to PySide6 for a cleaner and more flexible interface.  
- Integrated subtitle-to-text and MP4-to-MP3 modules with progress bars and proper error handling.  
- Fixed bugs related to file selection, encoding, and MoviePy parameter compatibility.
